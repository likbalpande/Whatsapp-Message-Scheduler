# Whatsapp-Message-Scheduler

It is a Backend Project made using SpringBoot and JAVA. 

This is my practice to learn SpringBoot and JAVA implementation while interning at Gupshup. It has no frontend but is a purely backend, however you can check the API endpoints once served on Tomcat. It uses Gupshup WhatsApp message scheduling API to send messages on the particular time.

You can call the endpoint to send the message, dateTime and token to schedule the message. The application will store the data and send the message at approximately same time as required with a margin of 1 minute. 

You will need to use it as a Spring-Boot Starter Project.
